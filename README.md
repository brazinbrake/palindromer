# palindromer
Java user input program to evaluate criteria for palindromes.
Developed using IntelliJ IDEA in Fedora 31. See src directory for fully commented Main and Palindromes Java classes.

Notes: 
Originally created an integer constructor before the user input was added. Could also have combined the even and odd processing easily enough, 
but shows two ways of getting to the answer while processing through the arrays.
